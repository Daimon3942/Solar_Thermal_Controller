#need to add the top line for all programs
#This program will run a closed loop SDHW system with a second pump to
#recirc. from SST to DHW htr.
#in addition, this program will allow for additional sensors on the SST
#to determine how much stratification is taking place
#this system should also be able to add crude CT's used to tell if the
#pumps are running and if a elec. water heater is running.
#
#what mod's are needed?
